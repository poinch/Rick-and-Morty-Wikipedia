# Rick & Morty Wikipedia üß™ü§™

This project is a Rick and Morty Wiki. The application consists of a listing of all the series' characters as well as a details page for each one of them. The app also consumes the fantastic [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql).

It is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and it uses the new [`Just-in-Time Mode`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) for Tailwind CSS.
